up down obstacle avoiding game

first it asks for camera option for default camera enter 0, for usb camera enter 1 or you can also enter ip address of wifi camera and then CLICK ON THE WINDOW pressing enter will not work

I took this idea from a instagram filter and made game for it.

for requirements run : pip install -r requirements.txt

in this game you have to avoid your face from striking the pipes, you have got 3 lives and as score increases speed of pipes increases.
